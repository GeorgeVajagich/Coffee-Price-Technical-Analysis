## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

df=read_csv("Coffee_Price_Since_1973.csv")
df$date<- mdy(df$date)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date, y = value, group = 1))+
  geom_line()+
  scale_x_date(breaks="5 years", labels = date_format("%Y"))
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
